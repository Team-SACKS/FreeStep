# FreeStep

This was a HackDavis 2020 project aimed to target the homeless population. The goal was to provide a form of "banking" for the homeless population using cryptocurrency. 

The site acts as a display of the transaction tracking process that would be used to look at how homeless people spent their money. These transactions would affect the rating system in place. Rating systems would define how much money a homeless person would receive. 

Transactions would be processed using banking APIs.
